# FitLog
**Work in Progress**

**Premise of idea stems from time spent providing personal training services. Clients are generally given instructions for cardio sessions outside of the time they pay for with an actual trainer. This simple app provides a "log" of cardio session's to serve a couple of different purposes. The first being to provide a visual representation of work done over time in the form of various data visualizations. Secondly, to allow for the user to provide accurate measureables for the trainer to more appropriately gauge a client's progress and needs.
# User Story

**1. User will be able to use the most commmon of cardio equipment and note the metrics that they provide at the end of a session. Initially utilizing treadmill, bike, and elliptical machines. They all provide the same available types of data in the form of Minutes, Miles/distance, and k/cal burned.**

**2. I want to keep the amount of input to a minimum in the early stages as to make the user experience as easy as possible. With this in mind the user will have a simple initial input form to "log" the session into memory.**

**3. User will have a dashboard available that will provide a number of visuals in the form of graphs over a given amount of time. Most likely initial view being previous 30 days. Tracking weight, type of session, minutes, distance traveled, and a heat map for activity.**
